   READ_TERMINAL is function for reading terminals.  This function is
   called before function read_rule.  The function should return the
   name and the code of the next terminal.  If all terminals have been
   read the function returns NULL.  The return code should be
   nonnegative.

   READ_RULE is function called to read the next rule.  This function
   is called after function read_terminal.  The function should return
   the name of LHS rule and array of names of symbols in RHS of the
   rule (the array end marker should be NULL).  If all rules have been
   read the function returns NULL.  All symbol with name which was not
   provided the previous function are considered to be nonterminal.
   The function also returns translation given by abstract node name
   and its fields which will be translation of symbols (with indexes
   given in array *TRANSL) in the RHS of the rule.  All indexes in
   TRANSL should be different (so the translation of a symbol can not
   be represented twice).  The end marker of the array should be a
   negative value.  There is a reserved value of the translation
   symbol number denoting empty node.  It is value defined by macro
   YAEP_NIL_TRANSLATION_NUMBER.  If *TRANSL is NULL or contains only
   the end marker, translations of the rule will be nil node.  If
   ABS_NODE is NULL, abstract node is not created.  In this case
   *TRANSL should be NULL or contain at most one element which means
   that the translation of the rule will be nil node or the
   translation of the symbol in RHS given by the single array element.
   The cost of the abstract node if given is passed through

     slightly worse, and no usage of lookaheads does the worst.  The

   o one_parse_flag means building only one parse tree.  For
     unambiguous grammar the flag does not affect the result.  The
     default value is 1.

   o cost_flag means usage costs to build tree (trees if
     one_parse_flag is not set up) with minimal cost.  For unambiguous
     grammar the flag does not affect the result.  The default value
     is 0.

   o error_recovery_flag means making error recovery if syntax error
     occurred.  Otherwise, syntax error results in finishing parsing
     (although syntax_error is called once).  The default value is 1.

   o recovery_match means how much subsequent tokens should be
     successfully shifted to finish error recovery.  The default value

   The *root will be NULL only if syntax error was occurred and error
   recovery was switched off).  The function sets up *AMBIGOUS_P if we
   found that the grammar is ambiguous (it works even we asked only one
   parse tree without alternatives).

   The function READ_TOKEN provides input tokens.  It returns code the
   next input token and its attribute.  If the function returns
   negative value we've read all tokens.

   Function SYNTAX_ERROR prints error message about syntax error
   which occurred on token with number ERR_TOK_NUM and attribute
   ERR_TOK_ATTR.  The following four parameters describes made error
   recovery which ignored tokens starting with token given by 3rd and
   4th parameters.  The first token which was not ignored is described
   by the last parameters.  If the number of ignored tokens is zero,
   the all parameters describes the same token.  If the error recovery
   is not made (see comments for function
   `yaep_set_error_recovery_flag'), the third and fifth parameters
   will be negative and forth and sixth parameters will be NULL.


   Function PARSE_ALLOC is used by YAEP to allocate memory
   for parse tree representation.  After calling yaep_fin we free
   all memory allocated by yaep parser.  At this point it is
   convenient to free all memory but parse tree.  Therefore we require
   the following function. If PARSE_ALLOC is a null pointer, then
   PARSE_FREE must also be a null pointer. In this case, YAEP will
   handle the memory management. Otherwise, the caller will be responsible to
   allocate and free memory for parse tree representation.  But the
   caller should not free the memory until yaep_fin is called.  The
   function may be called even during reading the grammar not only
   during the parsing.  Function PARSE_FREE is used by the parser to
   free memory allocated by PARSE_ALLOC. If PARSE_ALLOC is not NULL
   but PARSE_FREE is, the memory is not freed. In this case, the
   returned parse tree should also not be freed with yaep_free_tree(). */
