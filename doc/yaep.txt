  This document describes YAEP (Yet Another Earley Parser) written in
  C/C++.

  1.  YAEP

  YAEP is an abbreviation of Yet Another Earley Parser. The package
  `YAEP' implements earley parser. The earley parser implementation has
  the following features:


  o  It is sufficiently fast and does not require much memory.  This is
     the fastest implementation of Earley parser which I know. The main
     design goal is to achieve speed and memory requirements which are
     necessary to use it in prototype compilers and language processors.
     It parses 30K lines of C program per second on 500 MHz Pentium III
     and allocates about 5Mb memory for 10K line C program.

  o  It makes simple syntax directed translation. So an abstract tree is
     already the output of YAEP.

  o  It can parse input described by an ambiguous grammar. In this case
     the parse result can be an abstract tree or all possible abstract
     trees. Moreover it produces the compact representation of all
     possible parse trees by using DAG instead of real trees. This
     feature can be used to parse natural language sentences.

  o  It can parse input described by an ambiguous grammar according to
     the abstract node costs. In this case the parse result can be an
     minimal cost abstract tree or all possible minimal cost abstract
     trees. This feature can be used to code selection task in
     compilers.

  o  It can make syntax error recovery. Moreover its error recovery
     algorithms finds error recovery with minimal number of ignored
     tokens. It permits to implement parsers with very good error
     recovery and reporting.

  o  It has fast startup. There is no practically delay between
     processing grammar and start of parsing.

  o  It has flexible interface. The input grammar can be given by YACC-
     like description or providing functions returning terminals and
     rules.

  o  It has good debugging features. It can print huge amount of
     information about grammar, parsing, error recovery, translation.
     You can even output the result translation in form for a graphic
     visualization program.

  The interface part of the parser is file `yaep.h'. The implementation
  part is file `yaep.c'. The interface contains the following external
  definitions and macros:

     Struct `grammar'
        describes a grammar. Knowledge of structure (implementation) of
        this type is not visible and not needed for using the parser.

     Macro `YAEP_NIL_TRANSLATION_NUMBER'
        is reserved to be designation of empty node for translation.

     Macro `YAEP_NO_MEMORY'
        is error code of the parser. The parser functions return the
        code when parser can not allocate enough memory for its work.

     Macro `YAEP_UNDEFINED_OR_BAD_GRAMMAR'
        is error code of the parser. The parser functions return the
        code when we call parsing without defining grammar or call
        parsing for bad defined grammar.

     Macro `YAEP_DESCRIPTION_SYNTAX_ERROR_CODE'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when the
        grammar is defined by description and there is syntax error in
        the description.

     Macro `YAEP_FIXED_NAME_USAGE'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when the
        grammar uses reserved names for terminals and nonterminals.
        There are two reserved names `$S' (for axiom) and `$eof' for end
        of file (input end marker). The parser adds these symbols and
        rules with these symbols to the grammar given by user. So user
        should not use these names in his grammar.

     Macro `YAEP_REPEATED_TERM_DECL'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when the
        grammar contains several declarations of terminals with the same
        name.

     Macro `YAEP_NEGATIVE_TERM_CODE'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when the
        grammar terminal is described with negative code.

     Macro `YAEP_REPEATED_TERM_CODE'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when the two
        or more grammar terminals are described with the same code.

     Macro `YAEP_NO_RULES'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when the
        grammar given by user has no rules.

     Macro `YAEP_TERM_IN_RULE_LHS'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when grammar
        rule given by user contains terminal in left hand side of the
        rule.

     Macro `YAEP_INCORRECT_TRANSLATION'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when grammar
        rule translation is not correct. The single reason for this is
        translation of the rule consists of translations of more one
        symbols in the right hand side of the rule without forming an
        abstract tree node.

     Macro `YAEP_NEGATIVE COST'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when abstract
        node has a negative cost.

     Macro `YAEP_INCORRECT_SYMBOL_NUMBER'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when grammar
        rule translation contains incorrect symbol number which should
        be nonnegative number less than rule right hand side length.

     Macro `YAEP_UNACCESSIBLE_NONTERM'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when there is
        grammar nonterminal which can not be derived from axiom.

     Macro `YAEP_NONTERM_DERIVATION'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when there is
        grammar nonterminal which can not derive a terminal string.

     Macro `YAEP_LOOP_NONTERM'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when there is
        grammar nonterminal which can derive only itself.  The parser
        does not work with such grammars.

     Macro `YAEP_INVALID_TOKEN_CODE'
        is error code of the parser. The code is returned when the
        parser got input token whose code is different from all grammar
        terminal codes.

     Enumeration `yaep_tree_node_type'
        describes all possible nodes of abstract tree representing the
        translation. There are the following enumeration constants:

        `YAEP_NIL'
           the corresponding node represents empty translations.

        `YAEP_ERROR'
           the corresponding node represents translation of special
           terminal `error' (see error recovery).

        `YAEP_TERM'
           the corresponding node represents translation of a terminal.

        `YAEP_ANODE'
           the corresponding node represents an abstract node.

        `YAEP_ALT'
           the corresponding node represents an alternative of the
           translation. Such nodes creates only when there are two or
           more possible translations. It means that the grammar is
           ambiguous.

     Structure `yaep_tree_node'
        represents node of the translation. The nodes refer for each
        other forming DAG (direct acyclic graph) in general case. The
        main reason of generating DAG is that some input fragments may
        have the same translation, when there are several parsings of
        input (which is possible only for ambiguous grammars). But DAG
        may be created even for unambigous grammar because some nodes
        (empty and error nodes) exist only in one exemplar. When such
        nodes are not created, the translation nodes forms a tree. This
        structure has the following members:

        Member `type' of type `enum yaep_tree_node_type'
           representing type of the translation node.

        Union `val'
           Depending on the translation node type, one of the union
           members `nil', `error', `term', `anode', and `alt' of the
           structure types described below is used to represent the
           translation node.

     Structure `yaep_nil'
        represents empty node. It has no members. Actually the
        translation is DAG (not tree) in general case. The empty and
        error nodes are present only in one exemplar.

     Structure `yaep_error'
        represents translation of special terminal `error'. It has no
        members. The error node exists only in one exemplar.

     Structure `yaep_term'
        represents translation of terminals. It has the following two
        members:

        Integer member `code'
           representing code of the corresponding terminal.

        Member `attr' of type `* void'
           is reference for the attribute of the corresponding terminal.

     Structure `yaep_anode'
        represents abstract node. It has the following two members:

        Member `name' of type `const char *'
           representing name of anode as it given in the corresponding
           rule translation.

        Member `cost' of type `int'
           representing cost of the node plus costs of all children if
           the cost flag is set up. Otherwise, the value is cost of the
           abstract node itself.

        Member `children' of type `struct yaep_tree_node **'
           is array of nodes representing the translations of the
           symbols given in the rule with the abstract node.

     Structure `yaep_alt'
        represents an alternative of the translation. It has the
        following two members:

        Member `node' of type `struct yaep_tree_node *'
           representing alternative translation.

        Member `next' of type `struct yaep_tree_node *'
           is reference for the next alternative of translation.

     Function `yaep_create_grammar'


                    `struct grammar *yaep_create_grammar (void)'



     should be called the first. It actually creates an yaep parser with
     undefined grammar. You can use two or more parsers simultaneously.
     The function returns `NULL' if there is no memory.

     Function `yaep_error_code'


                    `int yaep_error_code (struct grammar *g)'



     returns the last occurred error code (see the possible error codes
     above) for given parser. If the function returns zero, no error was
     found so far.

     Function `yaep_error_message'


                    `const char *yaep_error_message (struct grammar *g)'



     returns detail message about last occurred error. The message
     always corresponds to the last error code returned the previous
     function.

     Function `yaep_read_grammar'


                    `int yaep_read_grammar (struct grammar *g, int strict_p,
                                            const char *(*read_terminal) (int *code),
                                            const char *(*read_rule)
                                                          (const char ***rhs,
                                                           const char **abs_node,
                                                           int *anode_cost,
                                                           int **transl))'



     is one of two functions which tunes the parser to given grammar.
     The grammar is read with the aid functions given as parameters.

     `read_terminal' is function for reading terminals. This function is
     called before function `read_rule'. The function should return the
     name and the code of the next terminal. If all terminals have been
     read the function returns NULL. The terminal code should be
     nonnegative.

     `read_rule' is function called to read the next rule. This function
     is called after function `read_terminal'. The function should
     return the name of nonterminal in the left hand side of the rule
     and array of names of symbols in the right hand side of the rule
     (the array end marker should be `NULL'). If all rules have been
     read, the function returns `NULL'. All symbol with name which was
     not provided function `read_terminal' are considered to be
     nonterminals.  The function also returns translation given by
     abstract node name and its fields which will be translation of
     symbols (with indexes given in array given by parameter `transl')
     in the right hand side of the rule. All indexes in `transl' should
     be different (so the translation of a symbol can not be represented
     twice). The end marker of the array should be a negative value.
     There is a reserved value of the translation symbol number denoting
     empty node. It is value defined by macro
     `YAEP_NIL_TRANSLATION_NUMBER'. If parameter `transl' is `NULL' or
     contains only the end marker, translations of the rule will be
     empty node. If `abs_node' is `NULL', abstract node is not created.
     In this case `transl' should be null or contain at most one
     element.  This means that the translation of the rule will be
     correspondingly empty node or the translation of the symbol in the
     right hand side given by the single array element. The cost of the
     abstract node if given is passed through parameter `anode_cost'. If
     `abs_node' is not `NULL', the cost should be greater or equal to
     zero.  Otherwise the cost is ignored.

     There is reserved terminal `error' which is used to mark start
     point of error recovery.

     Nonzero parameter `strict_p' value means more strict checking the
     grammar. In this case, all nonterminals will be checked on ability
     to derive a terminal string instead of only checking axiom for
     this.

     The function returns zero if it is all ok. Otherwise, the function
     returns the error code occured.

     Function `yaep_parse_grammar'


                    `int yaep_parse_grammar (struct grammar *g, int strict_p,
                                             const char *description)'



     is another function which tunes the parser to given grammar.  The
     grammar is given by string `description'. The description is simil-
     iar YACC one. It has the following syntax:


                       file : file terms [';']
                            | file rule
                            | terms [';']
                            | rule

                       terms : terms IDENTIFIER ['=' NUMBER]
                             | TERM

                       rule : IDENTIFIER ':' rhs [';']

                       rhs : rhs '|' sequence [translation]
                           | sequence [translation]

                       sequence :
                                | sequence IDENTIFIER
                                | sequence C_CHARACTER_CONSTANT

                       translation : '#'
                                   | '#' NUMBER
                                   | '#' '-'
                                   | '#' IDENTIFIER [NUMBER] '(' numbers ')'

                       numbers :
                               | numbers NUMBER
                               | numbers '-'



     So the description consists of terminal declaration and rules sec-
     tions.

     Terminal declaration section describes name of terminals and their
     codes. Terminal code is optional. If it is omitted, the terminal
     code will the next free code starting with 256.  You can declare
     terminal several times (the single condition its code should be the
     same).

     Character constant present in the rules is a terminal described by
     default. Its code is always code of the character constant.

     Rules syntax is the same as YACC rule syntax. The single difference
     is an optional translation construction starting with `#' right
     after each alternative. The translation part could be a single
     number which means that the translation of the alternative will be
     the translation of the symbol with given number (symbol numbers in
     alternative starts with 0).  Or the translation can be empty or `-'
     which mean empty node. Or the translation can be abstract node with
     given name, optional cost, and with fields whose values are the
     translations of the alternative symbols with numbers given in
     parentheses after the abstract node name. You can use `-' in
     abstract node to show that empty node should be used in this place.
     If the cost is absent it is believed to be one. The cost of
     terminal, error node, and empty node is always zero.

     There is reserved terminal `error' which is used to mark start
     point of error recovery.

     Function `yaep_set_lookahead_level'


                    `int yaep_set_lookahead_level (struct grammar *grammar,
                                                   int level)'



     sets up level of usage of look ahead in parser work. Value zero
     means no usage of lookaheads at all. Lookahead with static (inde-
     pendent on input tokens) context sets in parser situation (value 1)
     gives the best results with the point of view of space and speed,
     lookahead with dynamic (dependent on input tokens) context sets in
     parser situations (all the rest parameter values) does slightly
     worse, and no usage of lookaheads does the worst. The default value
     is 1 (lookahead with static situation context sets). The function
     returns the previously set up level. If the level value is nega-
     tive, zero is used instead of it. If the value is greater than two,
     two is used in this case.

     Function `yaep_set_debug_level'


                    `int yaep_set_debug_level (struct grammar *grammar,
                                               int level)'



     sets up level of debugging information output to `stderr'.  The
     more level, the more information is output. The default value is 0
     (no output). The debugging information includes statistics, result
     translation tree, grammar, parser sets, parser sets with all situa-
     tions, situations with contexts. The function returns the previ-
     ously set up debug level. Setting up negative debug level results
     in output of translation for program `dot' of graphic visualization
     package `graphviz'.

     Function `yaep_set_one_parse_flag'


                    `int yaep_set_one_parse_flag (struct grammar *grammar,
                                                  int flag)'



     sets up building only one translation tree (parameter value 0) or
     all parse trees for ambiguous grammar for which several parsings
     are possible. For unambiguous grammar the flag does not affect the
     result. The default value is 1.  The function returns the previ-
     ously used flag value.

     Function `yaep_set_cost_flag'


                    `int yaep_set_cost_flag (struct grammar *grammar, int flag)'



     sets up building only translation tree (trees if we set up
     one_parse_flag to 0) with minimal cost. For unambiguous grammar the
     flag does not affect the result. The default value is 0. The func-
     tion returns the previously used flag value.

     Function `yaep_set_error_recovery_flag'


                    `int yaep_set_error_recovery_flag (struct grammar *grammar,
                                                       int flag)'



     sets up internal flag whose nonzero value means making error recov-
     ery if syntax error occurred. Otherwise, syntax error results in
     finishing parsing (although function `syntax_error' in function
     `yaep_parse' will be called once). The default value is 1. The
     function returns the previously used flag value.

     Function `yaep_set_recovery_match'


                    `int yaep_set_recovery_match (struct grammar *grammar,
                                                  int n_toks)'



     sets up recovery parameter which means how much subsequent tokens
     should be successfully shifted to finish error recovery. The
     default value is 3. The function returns the previously used flag
     value.

     Function `yaep_parse'


                    `int yaep_parse (struct grammar *grammar,
                                     int (*read_token) (void **attr),
                                     void (*syntax_error)
                                          (int err_tok_num, void *err_tok_attr,
                                           int start_ignored_tok_num,
                                           void *start_ignored_tok_attr,
                                           int start_recovered_tok_num,
                                           void *start_recovered_tok_attr),
                                     void *(*parse_alloc) (int nmemb),
                                     void (*parse_free) (void *mem),
                                     struct yaep_tree_node **root,
                                     int *ambiguous_p)'



     is major parser function. It parses input according the grammar.
     The function returns the error code (which can be also returned by
     `yaep_error_code'). If the code is zero, the function will also
     return root of the parse tree through parameter `root'. The tree
     representing the translation. Value passed through `root' will be
     `NULL' only if syntax error was occurred and error recovery was
     switched off. The function sets up flag passed by parameter
     `ambiguous_p' if we found that the grammar is ambiguous (it works
     even we asked only one parse tree without alternatives).

     Function `read_token' provides input tokens. It returns code the
     next input token and its attribute. If the function returns
     negative value we've read all tokens.

     Function `syntax_error' called when synatctic error has been found.
     It may print an error message about syntax error which occurred on
     token with number `err_tok_num' and attribute `err_tok_attr'. The
     following four parameters describes made error recovery which
     ignored tokens starting with token given by 3rd and 4th parameters.
     The first token which was not ignored is described by the last
     parameters.  If the number of ignored tokens is zero, the all
     parameters describes the same token. If the error recovery is
     switched off (see comments for `yaep_set_error_recovery_flag'), the
     third and the fifth parameters will be negative and the forth and
     the sixth parameters will be `NULL'.

     Function `parse_alloc' is used by YAEP to allocate memory for parse
     tree representation (translation). After calling
     `yaep_free_grammar' we free all memory allocated for the parser. At
     this point it is convenient to free all memory but parse tree.
     Therefore we require the following function. So the caller will be
     responsible to allocate and free memory for parse tree
     representation (translation).  But the caller should not free the
     memory until `yaep_free_grammar' is called for the parser. The
     function may be called even during reading the grammar not only
     during the parsing. Function `parse_free' is used by the parser to
     free memory allocated by `parse_alloc'. If it is `NULL', the memory
     is not freed.

     Function `yaep_free_grammar'


                    `void yaep_free_grammar (struct grammar *grammar)'



     frees all memory allocated for the parser. This function should be
     called the last for given parser.
