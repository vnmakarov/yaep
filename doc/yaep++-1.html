<P>YAEP is an abbreviation of Yet Another Earley Parser.  The package
`YAEP' implements earley parser.  The earley parser implementation has
the following features:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>It is sufficiently fast and does not require much memory.
This is the fastest implementation of Earley parser which I
know.  The main design goal is to achieve speed and memory
requirements which are necessary to use it in prototype
compilers and language processors.  It parses 30K lines of C
program per second on 500 MHz Pentium III and allocates about
5Mb memory for 10K line C program.
</LI>
<LI>It makes simple syntax directed translation.  So an
abstract tree is already the output of YAEP.
</LI>
<LI>It can parse input described by an ambiguous grammar.  In
this case the parse result can be an abstract tree or all
possible abstract trees.  Moreover it produces the compact
representation of all possible parse trees by using DAG instead
of real trees.  This feature can be used to parse natural
language sentences.
</LI>
<LI>It can parse input described by an ambiguous grammar
according to the abstract node costs.  In this case the parse
result can be an minimal cost abstract tree or all possible
minimal cost abstract trees.  This feature can be used to code
selection task in compilers.
</LI>
<LI>It can make syntax error recovery.  Moreover its error
recovery algorithms finds error recovery with minimal number of
ignored tokens.  It permits to implement parsers with very good
error recovery and reporting.
</LI>
<LI>It has fast startup.  There is no practically delay between
processing grammar and start of parsing.
</LI>
<LI>It has flexible interface.  The input grammar can be given
by YACC-like description or providing functions returning
terminals and rules.
</LI>
<LI>It has good debugging features.  It can print huge amount of
information about grammar, parsing, error recovery, translation.
You can even output the result translation in form for a graphic
visualization program.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The interface part of the parser is file `yaep.h'.  The
implementation part is file `yaep.cpp'.  The interface contains the
following external definitions and macros:
<DL>
<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_NIL_TRANSLATION_NUMBER'</B><DD>
<P>is reserved to be designation of empty node for translation.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_NO_MEMORY'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The parser functions return
the code when parser can not allocate enough memory for its
work.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_UNDEFINED_OR_BAD_GRAMMAR'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The parser functions return
the code when we call parsing without defining grammar or
call parsing for bad defined grammar.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_DESCRIPTION_SYNTAX_ERROR_CODE'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the
grammar is defined by description and there is syntax error
in the description.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_FIXED_NAME_USAGE'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the
grammar uses reserved names for terminals and nonterminals.
There are two reserved names `$S' (for axiom) and `$eof' for
end of file (input end marker).  The parser adds these
symbols and rules with these symbols to the grammar given by
user.  So user should not use these names in his grammar.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_REPEATED_TERM_DECL'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the
grammar contains several declarations of terminals with the
same name.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_NEGATIVE_TERM_CODE'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the
grammar terminal is described with negative code.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_REPEATED_TERM_CODE'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the
two or more grammar terminals are described with the same
code.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_NO_RULES'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the
grammar given by user has no rules.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_TERM_IN_RULE_LHS'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when
grammar rule given by user contains terminal in left hand
side of the rule.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_INCORRECT_TRANSLATION'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when
grammar rule translation is not correct.  The single reason
for this is translation of the rule consists of translations
of more one symbols in the right hand side of the rule
without forming an abstract tree node.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_NEGATIVE COST'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when
abstract node has a negative cost.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_INCORRECT_SYMBOL_NUMBER'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when
grammar rule translation contains incorrect symbol number
which should be nonnegative number less than rule right hand
side length.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_UNACCESSIBLE_NONTERM'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when
there is grammar nonterminal which can not be derived from
axiom.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_NONTERM_DERIVATION'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when
there is grammar nonterminal which can not derive a terminal
string.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_LOOP_NONTERM'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when
there is grammar nonterminal which can derive only itself.
The parser does not work with such grammars.</P>

<DT><B>Macro `YAEP_INVALID_TOKEN_CODE'</B><DD>
<P>is error code of the parser.  The code is returned when the
parser got input token whose code is different from all
grammar terminal codes.</P>

<DT><B>Enumeration `yaep_tree_node_type'</B><DD>
<P>describes all possible nodes of abstract tree representing
the translation.  There are the following enumeration
constants:
<DL>
<DT><B>`YAEP_NIL'</B><DD>
<P>the corresponding node represents empty translations.</P>

<DT><B>`YAEP_ERROR'</B><DD>
<P>the corresponding node represents translation of
special terminal `error' (see error recovery).</P>

<DT><B>`YAEP_TERM'</B><DD>
<P>the corresponding node represents translation of
a terminal.</P>

<DT><B>`YAEP_ANODE'</B><DD>
<P>the corresponding node represents an abstract node.</P>

<DT><B>`YAEP_ALT'</B><DD>
<P>the corresponding node represents an alternative of the
translation.  Such nodes creates only when there are
two or more possible translations.  It means that the
grammar is ambiguous.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<DT><B>Structure `yaep_tree_node'</B><DD>
<P>represents node of the translation.  The nodes refer for
each other forming DAG (direct acyclic graph) in general
case.  The main reason of generating DAG is that some input
fragments may have the same translation, when there are
several parsings of input (which is possible only for
ambiguous grammars).  But DAG may be created even for
unambigous grammar because some nodes (empty and error
nodes) exist only in one exemplar.  When such nodes are not
created, the translation nodes forms a tree.  This structure
has the following members:
<DL>
<DT><B>Member `type' of type `enum yaep_tree_node_type'</B><DD>
<P>representing type of the translation node.</P>

<DT><B>Union `val'</B><DD>
<P>Depending on the translation node type, one of the
union members `nil', `error', `term', `anode', and
`alt' of the structure types described below is used to
represent the translation node.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<DT><B>Structure `yaep_nil'</B><DD>
<P>represents empty node.  It has no members.  Actually the
translation is DAG (not tree) in general case.  The empty
and error nodes are present only in one exemplar.</P>

<DT><B>Structure `yaep_error'</B><DD>
<P>represents translation of special terminal `error'.  It has
no members.  The error node exists only in one exemplar.</P>

<DT><B>Structure `yaep_term'</B><DD>
<P>represents translation of terminals.  It has
the following two members:
<DL>
<DT><B>Integer member `code'</B><DD>
<P>representing code of the corresponding terminal.</P>

<DT><B>Member `cost' of type `int'</B><DD>
<P>representing cost of the node plus costs of all
children if the cost flag is set up.  Otherwise, the
value is cost of the abstract node itself.</P>

<DT><B>Member `attr' of type `* void'</B><DD>
<P>is reference for the attribute of the corresponding
terminal.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<DT><B>Structure `yaep_anode'</B><DD>
<P>represents abstract node.  It has the following two members:
<DL>
<DT><B>Member `name' of type `const char *'</B><DD>
<P>representing name of anode as it given in the
corresponding rule translation.</P>

<DT><B>Member `children' of type `struct yaep_tree_node **'</B><DD>
<P>is array of nodes representing the translations of the
symbols given in the rule with the abstract node.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<DT><B>Structure `yaep_alt'</B><DD>
<P>represents an alternative of the translation.  It has the
following two members:
<DL>
<DT><B>Member `node' of type `struct yaep_tree_node *'</B><DD>
<P>representing alternative translation.</P>

<DT><B>Member `next' of type `struct yaep_tree_node *'</B><DD>
<P>is reference for the next alternative of translation.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<DT><B>Class `yaep'</B><DD>
<P>Earley parsers are objects of this class.  The class has the
following members:

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

is one of two functions which tunes the parser to given
grammar.  The grammar is read with the aid functions
given as parameters.</P>
<P>`read_terminal' is function for reading terminals.  This
function is called before function `read_rule'.  The
function should return the name and the code of the next
terminal.  If all terminals have been read the function
returns NULL.  The terminal code should be nonnegative.</P>
<P>`read_rule' is function called to read the next rule.
This function is called after function `read_terminal'.
The function should return the name of nonterminal in the
left hand side of the rule and array of names of symbols
in the right hand side of the rule (the array end marker
should be `NULL').  If all rules have been read, the
function returns `NULL'.  All symbol with name which was
not provided function `read_terminal' are considered to
be nonterminals.  The function also returns translation
given by abstract node name and its fields which will be
translation of symbols (with indexes given in array given
by parameter `transl') in the right hand side of the
rule.  All indexes in `transl' should be different (so
the translation of a symbol can not be represented
twice).  The end marker of the array should be a negative
value.  There is a reserved value of the translation
symbol number denoting empty node.  It is value defined
by macro `YAEP_NIL_TRANSLATION_NUMBER'.  If parameter
`transl' is `NULL' or contains only the end marker,
translations of the rule will be empty node.  If
`abs_node' is `NULL', abstract node is not created.  In
this case `transl' should be null or contain at most one
element.  This means that the translation of the rule
will be correspondingly empty node or the translation of
the symbol in the right hand side given by the single
array element. The cost of the abstract node if given is
passed through parameter `anode_cost'.  If `abs_node' is
not `NULL', the cost should be greater or equal to zero.
Otherwise the cost is ignored.</P>
<P>There is reserved terminal `error' which is used to mark
start point of error recovery.</P>
<P>Nonzero parameter `strict_p' value means more strict
checking the grammar.  In this case, all nonterminals
will be checked on ability to derive a terminal string
instead of only checking axiom for this.</P>
<P>The function returns zero if it is all ok.  Otherwise,
the function returns the error code occured.</P>

is another function which tunes the parser to given
grammar.  The grammar is given by string `description'.
The description is similiar YACC one.  It has the
following syntax:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
                file : file terms [';']

                      | TERM
   
                rule : IDENTIFIER ':' rhs [';']
             
                rhs : rhs '|' sequence [translation]

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

So the description consists of terminal declaration and
rules sections.</P>
<P>Terminal declaration section describes name of terminals
and their codes.  Terminal code is optional.  If it is
omitted, the terminal code will the next free code
starting with 256.  You can declare terminal several
times (the single condition its code should be the same).</P>
<P>Character constant present in the rules is a terminal
described by default.  Its code is always code of the
character constant.</P>
<P>Rules syntax is the same as YACC rule syntax.  The single
difference is an optional translation construction
starting with `#' right after each alternative.  The
translation part could be a single number which means
that the translation of the alternative will be the
translation of the symbol with given number (symbol
numbers in alternative starts with 0).  Or the
translation can be empty or `-' which mean empty node.
Or the translation can be abstract node with given name,
optional cost, and with fields whose values are the
translations of the alternative symbols with numbers
given in parentheses after the abstract node name.  You
can use `-' in abstract node to show that empty node
should be used in this place.  If the cost is absent it
is believed to be one.  The cost of terminal, error node,
and empty node is always zero.</P>
<P>There is reserved terminal `error' which is used to mark
start point of error recovery.</P>

sets up level of usage of look ahead in parser work.
Value zero means no usage of lookaheads at all.
Lookahead with static (independent on input tokens)
context sets in parser situation (value 1) gives the best
results with the point of view of space and speed,
lookahead with dynamic (dependent on input tokens)
context sets in parser situations (all the rest parameter
values) does slightly worse, and no usage of lookaheads
does the worst.  The default value is 1 (lookahead with
static situation context sets).  The function returns the
previously set up level.  If the level value is negative,
zero is used instead of it.  If the value is greater than
two, two is used in this case.</P>

sets up level of debugging information output to
`stderr'.  The more level, the more information is
output.  The default value is 0 (no output).  The
debugging information includes statistics, result
translation tree, grammar, parser sets, parser sets with
all situations, situations with contexts. The function
returns the previously set up debug level.  Setting up
negative debug level results in output of translation for

error recovery if syntax error occurred.  Otherwise,
syntax error results in finishing parsing (although

is major parser function.  It parses input according the
grammar.  The function returns the error code (which can
be also returned by `error_code').  If the code is zero,
the function will also return root of the parse tree
through parameter `root'.  The tree representing the
translation.  Value passed through `root' will be `NULL'
only if syntax error was occurred and error recovery was
switched off.  The function sets up flag passed by
parameter `ambiguous_p' if we found that the grammar is
ambiguous (it works even we asked only one parse tree
without alternatives).</P>
<P>Function `read_token' provides input tokens.  It returns
code the next input token and its attribute.  If the
function returns negative value we've read all tokens.</P>
<P>Function `syntax_error' called when synatctic error has
been found.  It may print an error message about syntax
error which occurred on token with number `err_tok_num'
and attribute `err_tok_attr'.  The following four
parameters describes made error recovery which ignored
tokens starting with token given by 3rd and 4th
parameters.  The first token which was not ignored is
described by the last parameters.  If the number of
ignored tokens is zero, the all parameters describes the
same token.  If the error recovery is switched off (see
comments for `set_error_recovery_flag'), the third and
the fifth parameters will be negative and the forth and
the sixth parameters will be `NULL'.</P>
<P>Function `parse_alloc' is used by YAEP to
allocate memory for parse tree representation
(translation).  After calling the class destructor we
free all memory allocated for the parser.  At this point
it is convenient to free all memory but parse tree.
Therefore we require the following function.  So the
caller will be responsible to allocate and free memory
for parse tree representation (translation).  But the
caller should not free the memory until destructor is
called for the parser.  The function may be called even
during reading the grammar not only during the parsing.
only during the parsing.  Function `parse_free' is used
by the parser to free memory allocated by `parse_alloc'.
If it is `NULL', the memory is not freed.</P>
